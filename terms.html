<p>A copy of your Notification will be sent to the person who posted or stored the material addressed in the Notification.

<p>(4) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address at which the complaining party may be contacted;</p>
<p>(5) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;</p>
<p>(6) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed upon.</p>
<p><strong>Counter Notification</strong></p>
<p>If you believe your own copyrighted material has been removed from the Site as a result of a mistake or misidentification, you may submit a written counter notification to <span>[us/our Designated Copyright Agent] </span>using the contact information provided below (a “Counter Notification”).</p>
